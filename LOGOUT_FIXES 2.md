# Logout Functionality Fixes

## Overview

Fixed logout functionality across the OPC Point platform to ensure proper user session termination and redirection to the login page.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sidebar Logout Button
**Location**: `/app/components/Sidebar.tsx`
**Problem**: Logout was redirecting to home page (`/`) instead of login page
**Fix**: Updated `handleLogout` function to redirect to `/passport/login`

```tsx
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  router.push('/passport/login'); // Changed from '/'
};
```

### 2. MemberHeader User Dropdown
**Location**: `/app/components/MemberHeader.tsx`
**Enhancement**: Added proper logout functionality with dropdown menu
**Features Added**:
- User dropdown menu with profile information
- Logout button in dropdown
- Click-outside handler to close dropdown
- Proper cleanup and redirection

```tsx
// New logout handler
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  router.push('/passport/login');
};
```

### 3. AdminSidebar Back to Main Site
**Location**: `/app/components/AdminSidebar.tsx`
**Problem**: "Back to The Point" button was a simple link
**Fix**: Updated to logout button with proper session termination

```tsx
const handleBackToMainSite = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  router.push('/passport/login');
};
```

## Updated Components

### Sidebar Component
- Fixed logout function to redirect to login
- Added proper async/await handling
- Maintained existing UI design

### MemberHeader Component
- Added dropdown functionality for user menu
- Integrated logout button in user dropdown
- Added click-outside detection
- Shows user profile information (name, email)
- Added proper TypeScript types

### AdminSidebar Component
- Changed "Back to The Point" to "Logout"
- Added proper logout functionality
- Maintains admin UI consistency

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistent Logout Behavior**: All logout actions now properly clear the session and redirect to login
2. **Better UX in Header**: User can see their profile info and logout from a dropdown
3. **Clear Admin Logout**: Admin users have a clear logout option
4. **No More Dead Ends**: No more redirecting to pages that don't handle logout state

## Security Benefits

1. **Proper Session Cleanup**: All logout actions now use `supabase.auth.signOut()`
2. **Consistent Redirection**: All logout actions redirect to the login page
3. **No Session Persistence**: Ensures user sessions are properly terminated

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test logout from main sidebar
2. Test logout from user dropdown in header
3. Test admin logout from admin sidebar
4. Verify all logout actions redirect to `/passport/login`
5. Verify session is properly cleared after logout
6. Test that protected routes redirect to login after logout

## Notes

- The logout page at `/passport/logout` was already correctly implemented
- All logout functions are now consistent across the platform
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
